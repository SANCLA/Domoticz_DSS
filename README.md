	 Domoticz Diagnostic Support Script
 
# SYNOPSIS
	Domoticz Diagnostic Support Script (DDSS)

# DESCRIPTION
	Domoticz users on the forum regularly request support from the Domoticz community. 
	Because the reason often concerns the failure or malfunctioning of the local Domoticz agency, 
	it is sometimes difficult to share the correct information. For example configuration files, 
	log files or properties of the environment. The aim of this script is to simplify this process by collecting 
	information from your own personal Domoticz environment in a simple, accessible but safe manner. 
	This information can then be shared with third parties, such as the Domoticz forum or (plugin) developers.
